cd to POM.xml. Then run the commands below. The first one builds the project.
The second comand runs the program.

## Maven commands

- `mvn compile`
  - Compile the source code of the project
- `mvn test`
  - Run the back-end test suite
- `mvn package`
  - Compile, test and package the project into a jar
- `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=se.lth.base.server.BaseServer`
  - Start the server (note: it has to be compiled first)
- `mvn clean`
  - Remove all files generated by `mvn` commands

It is possible to chain the commands simply by adding them after each other
without `mvn` in front of each command. For example, recompile the project and
start the server can be done with:

`mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=se.lth.base.server.BaseServer`
