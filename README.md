## Maven commands

All the commands need to be executed in the same directory as the _POM.xml_
file.

- `mvn compile`
  - Compile the source code of the project
- `mvn test`
  - Run the back-end test suite
- `mvn package`
  - Compile, test and package the project into a jar
- `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=se.lth.base.server.BaseServer`
  - Start the server (note: it has to be compiled first)
- `mvn clean`
  - Remove all files generated by `mvn` commands
- `mvn fmt:check`
  - Check if _.java_ files are formatted according to the google java code style
- `mvn fmt:format`
  - Format all _.java_ files according to the google java code style

It is possible to chain the commands simply by adding them after each other
without `mvn` in front of each command. For example, recompile the project and
start the server can be done with:

`mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=se.lth.base.server.BaseServer`
